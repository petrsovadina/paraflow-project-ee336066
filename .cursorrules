# Paraflow Project Development Rules

This is a project based on the Paraflow design system.

## Important Conventions

1. The paraflow/ directory contains original design files, do not modify directly
2. HTML UI components are in `paraflow/Screen & Prototype/` (22 files)
3. Design system is documented in `paraflow/Style Guide/`
4. Static resource files (images) are in `paraflow/` root directory
5. Create corresponding React/Next.js components based on design files

## Development Guidelines

- Maintain visual consistency with the original design
- Use design system from `paraflow/Style Guide/benjamin_green_healthcare.style-guide.md`
- HTML components contain embedded Tailwind CSS (no external CSS file)
- Component-based development with TypeScript
- Follow Next.js 14 app router conventions
